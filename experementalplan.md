[X]1. generate arbitrary data
[ ]2. calibrate on arbitrary data to discover most acurate loss funciton
[ ]3. Use accurate loss function to overfit to exclude algorithms 
[ ]4. Use best few algorithms and loss function going forward
[ ]5. Single workflow generalization experements 
	[ ]5.1 Diversity of CPU:Data Ratio needed?
	[ ]5.2 Budget required for ground truth data
		5.2.1 Strips?
		5.2.2 Squares?
		5.2.3 Something else?
[ ]6. Accross Workflow (train on N workflows, Test on ALL workflows)
	[ ]6.1 Chain Only
	[ ]6.2 Forkjoin Only
	[ ]6.3 Forkjoin AND chain only
	[ ]6.4 Duno, some subset of workflows??? (Easiest to install?)(same research area?)
[ ]7. Simulator sophistication required (single workflows at a time using previous results to inform)
